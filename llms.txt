The goal of funspotr (R function spotter) is to make it easy to identify
which R functions and packages are used in files and projects. It was
initially written to create reference tables of the functions and
packages used in a few popular github repositories[¹](#fn1).

There are roughly three types of functions in funspotr:

- `list_files_*()`: that identify files in a repository or related
  location
- `spot_*()`: that identify functions or packages in files
- other helpers that manipulate or plot outputs from the above functions

funspotr is set-up for parsing R, Rmarkdown or Quarto files. If you want
to parse a Jupyter notebook you should first [convert
it](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rmarkdown/versions/2.6/topics/convert_ipynb)
to an appropriate file type. If you pass in a file type that is not
recognized (e.g. a .txt file) funspotr will attempt to parse it as if it
is a .R script.

funspotr is primarily designed for identifying the functions / packages
in self-contained files or collections of self-contained files (e.g. a
[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) project[²](#fn2)).
Though see [Package dependencies in another
file](#package-dependencies-in-another-file) for examples of using it in
other contexts.

## Spot functions in a file

The primary function in funspotr is
[`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
which returns a dataframe showing the functions and associated packages
used in a file.

``` r
library(funspotr)

file_lines <- "
library(dplyr)
require(tidyr)

as_tibble(mpg) %>% 
  mutate(class = as.character(class)) %>%
  group_by(class) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(stats = purrr::map(data,
                            ~lm(cty ~ hwy, data = .x)))
 
made_up_fun()
"

file_output <- tempfile(fileext = ".R")
writeLines(file_lines, file_output)

spot_funs(file_path = file_output)
#> # A tibble: 10 × 2
#>    funs         pkgs     
#>    <chr>        <chr>    
#>  1 library      base     
#>  2 require      base     
#>  3 as_tibble    tidyr    
#>  4 mutate       dplyr    
#>  5 as.character base     
#>  6 group_by     dplyr    
#>  7 nest         tidyr    
#>  8 map          purrr    
#>  9 lm           stats    
#> 10 made_up_fun  (unknown)
```

- `funs`: functions in file
- `pkgs`: best guess as to the package the functions came from  
- …[³](#fn3)

## Spot functions on all files in a project

funspotr has a few `list_files_*()` functions that return a dataframe of
`relative_paths` and `absolute_paths` of all the R, Rmarkdown, or quarto
files in a specified location (currently: github repo, gists, or local).
These can be combined with a variant of
[`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
that maps the function across each file path found,
[`spot_funs_files()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs_files.md):

``` r
library(dplyr)

# repo for an old presentation I gave
gh_ex <- list_files_github_repo(
  repo = "brshallo/feat-eng-lags-presentation", 
  branch = "main") %>% 
  spot_funs_files()

gh_ex
#> # A tibble: 4 × 3
#>   relative_paths                absolute_paths                      spotted     
#>   <chr>                         <chr>                               <list>      
#> 1 R/Rmd-to-R.R                  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/… <named list>
#> 2 R/feat-engineering-lags.R     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/… <named list>
#> 3 R/load-inspections-save-csv.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/… <named list>
#> 4 R/types-of-splits.R           https://raw.githubusercontent.com/… <named list>
```

- `relative_paths` : relative filepath
- `absolute_paths`: absolute filepath (in this case URL to raw file on
  github)
- `spotted`:
  [`purrr::safely()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/safely.html)
  style list-column of results[⁴](#fn4) from mapping
  [`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
  across `absolute_paths`.

These results may then be unnested with the helper
[`funspotr::unnest_results()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/unnest_results.md)
to provide a table of functions and packages by filepath. This can be
manipulated like any other dataframe – say we want to filter to only
those files where [here](https://here.r-lib.org/),
[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) or
[rsample](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/) packages are used.

``` r
gh_ex %>% 
  unnest_results() %>% 
  filter(pkgs %in% c("here", "readr", "rsample"))
#> # A tibble: 8 × 4
#>   funs               pkgs    relative_paths                absolute_paths       
#>   <chr>              <chr>   <chr>                         <chr>                
#> 1 here               here    R/Rmd-to-R.R                  https://raw.githubus…
#> 2 read_csv           readr   R/feat-engineering-lags.R     https://raw.githubus…
#> 3 initial_time_split rsample R/feat-engineering-lags.R     https://raw.githubus…
#> 4 training           rsample R/feat-engineering-lags.R     https://raw.githubus…
#> 5 testing            rsample R/feat-engineering-lags.R     https://raw.githubus…
#> 6 sliding_period     rsample R/feat-engineering-lags.R     https://raw.githubus…
#> 7 write_csv          readr   R/load-inspections-save-csv.R https://raw.githubus…
#> 8 here               here    R/load-inspections-save-csv.R https://raw.githubus…
```

The outputs from
[`funspotr::unnest_results()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/unnest_results.md)
can also be passed into
[`funspotr::network_plot()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/network_plot.md)
to build a network visualization of the connections between
functions/packages and files[⁵](#fn5).

### Previewing and customizing files to parse

You might only want to parse certain file types or a subset of the files
in a repo.

``` r
preview_files <- list_files_github_repo(
  repo = "brshallo/feat-eng-lags-presentation", 
  branch = "main")

preview_files
#> # A tibble: 4 × 2
#>   relative_paths                absolute_paths                                  
#>   <chr>                         <chr>                                           
#> 1 R/Rmd-to-R.R                  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brshallo/feat…
#> 2 R/feat-engineering-lags.R     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brshallo/feat…
#> 3 R/load-inspections-save-csv.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brshallo/feat…
#> 4 R/types-of-splits.R           https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brshallo/feat…
```

Say we only want to parse the “types-of-splits.R” and “Rmd-to-R.R”
files.

``` r
preview_files %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(relative_paths, "types-of-splits|Rmd-to-R")) %>% 
  spot_funs_files() %>% 
  unnest_results()
#> # A tibble: 24 × 4
#>    funs      pkgs      relative_paths      absolute_paths                       
#>    <chr>     <chr>     <chr>               <chr>                                
#>  1 purl      knitr     R/Rmd-to-R.R        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  2 here      here      R/Rmd-to-R.R        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  3 library   base      R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  4 theme_set ggplot    R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  5 theme_bw  ggplot    R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  6 set.seed  base      R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  7 tibble    dplyr     R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  8 rep       base      R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#>  9 today     lubridate R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#> 10 days      lubridate R/types-of-splits.R https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br…
#> # ℹ 14 more rows
```

Note that if you have a lot of files in a repo you may need to set-up
sleep periods or clone the repo locally *and then* parse the files from
there so as to stay within the limits of github API hits.

## Other things

### Files you didn’t write

Functions created in the file as well as functions from unavailable
packages (or packages that don’t exist) will output as
`pkgs = "(unknown)"`.

``` r
file_lines_missing_pkgs <- "
library(dplyr)

as_tibble(mpg)

hello_world <- function() print('hello world')

madeuppkg::made_up_fun()

hello_world()
"

missing_pkgs_ex <- tempfile(fileext = ".R")
writeLines(file_lines_missing_pkgs, missing_pkgs_ex)

spot_funs(file_path = missing_pkgs_ex)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   funs        pkgs     
#>   <chr>       <chr>    
#> 1 library     base     
#> 2 as_tibble   dplyr    
#> 3 print       base     
#> 4 made_up_fun (unknown)
#> 5 hello_world (unknown)
```

*To spot which package a function is from you must have the package
installed locally.* Hence for files on others’ github repos or that you
created on a different machine, it is a good idea to start with
[`funspotr::check_pkgs_availability()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/check_pkgs_availability.md)
to see which packages you are missing and install the missing packages
locally. If you don’t want to edit your global library you may want to
use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) or other environment
management tools.

funspotr has an internal helper
[`funspotr::install_missing_pkgs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/install_missing_pkgs.md)
for installing missing packages:

``` r
spot_pkgs(file_output) %>%
  check_pkgs_availability() %>%
  funspotr::install_missing_pkgs()
```

Alternatively, you may want to clone the repository locally and then use
`renv::dependencies()` and only then start using funspotr[⁶](#fn6).

### Package dependencies in another file

[`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
is currently set-up for self-contained files. But
[`spot_funs_custom()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs_custom.md)
allows the user to explicitly specify `pkgs` where functions may come
from. This is useful in cases where the packages loaded are not in the
same location as the `file_path` (e.g. they are loaded via
[`source()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/source.html), or a DESCRIPTION file,
or some other workflow). For example, below is a made-up example where
the [`library()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html) calls are made in
a separate file and [`source()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/source.html)’d
in.

``` r
# file where packages are loaded
file_libs <- "library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)"

file_libs_output <- tempfile(fileext = ".R")
writeLines(file_libs, file_libs_output)

# File of interest where things happen
file_run <- glue::glue(
"source('{ file_libs_output }')
  
tibble::tibble(days_from_today = 0:10) %>% 
    mutate(date = today() + days(days_from_today))
", 
file_libs_output = stringr::str_replace_all(file_libs_output, "\\\\", "/")
)

file_run_output <- tempfile(fileext = ".R")
writeLines(file_run, file_run_output)

# Identify packages using both files and then pass in explicitly to `spot_funs_custom()`
pkgs <- c(spot_pkgs(file_libs_output), 
          spot_pkgs(file_run_output, show_explicit_funs = TRUE))

spot_funs_custom(
  pkgs = pkgs,
  file_path = file_run_output)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   funs   pkgs     
#>   <chr>  <chr>    
#> 1 source base     
#> 2 tibble tibble   
#> 3 mutate dplyr    
#> 4 today  lubridate
#> 5 days   lubridate
```

Also see
[`funspotr::spot_pkgs_from_description()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_pkgs_from_DESCRIPTION.md).

### Show all function calls

Passing in `show_each_use = TRUE` to `...` in
[`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
or
[`spot_funs_files()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs_files.md)
will return *all* instances of a function call rather than just once for
each file.

Compared to the initial example,
[`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) now
shows-up at both rows 4 and 8:

``` r
spot_funs(file_path = file_output, show_each_use = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 11 × 2
#>    funs         pkgs     
#>    <chr>        <chr>    
#>  1 library      base     
#>  2 require      base     
#>  3 as_tibble    tidyr    
#>  4 mutate       dplyr    
#>  5 as.character base     
#>  6 group_by     dplyr    
#>  7 nest         tidyr    
#>  8 mutate       dplyr    
#>  9 map          purrr    
#> 10 lm           stats    
#> 11 made_up_fun  (unknown)
```

### Helper for blog tags

*To automatically have your packages used as the tags for a blog post*
you can add an inline function
[`funspotr::spot_tags()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_tags.md)
to a bullet in the `tags` or `categories` argument of your YAML header.
For example:

``` R
---
title: This is a post
author: brshallo
date: '2022-02-11'
tags: ["`r funspotr::spot_tags()`"]
slug: this-is-a-post
---
```

## How `spot_funs()` works

funspotr mimics the search space of each file prior to identifying
`pkgs`/`funs`. At a high-level…

1.  Create a new R instance using
    [callr](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) and clean-up the specified
    file using [formatR](https://github.com/yihui/formatR)
2.  Load packages. Explicit calls (e.g. `pkg::fun()`) are loaded
    individually via [import](https://github.com/rticulate/import) and
    are loaded last (putting them at the top of the search
    space)[⁷](#fn7).

(steps 1 and 2 needed so that step 4 has the best chance of identifying
the package a function comes from in the file.)

3.  Pass file through
    [`utils::getParseData()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/getParseData.html)
    and filter to just functions
4.  Pass functions through
    [`utils::find()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/apropos.html) to identify
    associated package

## Limitations, problems, musings

- funspotr is specific to R. If you try and pass in a file from a
  different language you will get a parsing error or the code commented
  out[⁸](#fn8). The steps taken by funspotr would also not be needed in
  many other programming languages[⁹](#fn9).
- funspotr does not work perfectly at identifying functions or packages.
  One common example is it will not identify functions passed as
  arguments. For example it will not identify `mean` in this example:
  `lapply(x, mean)` . Similarly it will not identify functions within
  [`switch()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/switch.html). See
  [\#13](https://github.com/brshallo/funspotr/issues/13).
- If a file contains R syntax that is not well defined it will not be
  parsed and will return an error. See
  [formatR#further-notes](https://yihui.org/formatr/#6-further-notes)
  (used by funspotr in parsing) for other common reasons for failure.
- [`knitr::read_chunk()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/knitr/man/read_chunk.html)
  and [`knitr::purl()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/knitr/man/knit.html) in a
  file passed to funspotr will also frequently cause an error in
  parsing. See [knitr#1753](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1753)
  & [knitr#1938](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1938)
- Please open an issue if you find other cases where parsing breaks :-)
  .
- As mentioned elsewhere, the default parsing of
  [`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
  is primarily for cases where package dependencies are loaded in the
  same file that they are used in[¹⁰](#fn10). Scripts that are not
  self-contained typically should have the `pkgs` argument provided
  explicitly via
  [`spot_funs_custom()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs_custom.md).
- funspotr does not pay attention to when functions are reexported from
  elsewhere. For example, many tibble functions are reexported by dplyr
  and tidyr – funspotr though will not know the “true” home of these
  functions it is simply looking at the top of the search
  space[¹¹](#fn11).
- Feel free to open an issue if you’d be interested in a simplifying
  function or vignette for mapping
  [`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
  through other folder structures not yet mentioned.
- All the functions in “R/spot-pkgs.R” would probably be better handled
  by something like `renv::dependencies()` or a parsing based approach.
  The simple regex’s I use have a variety of problems[¹²](#fn12).
  - There may be something to be learned from how `R CMD check` does
    function parsing. funspotr’s current approach is comparatively slow
    and uses imperfect heuristics.
- Does not identify infix operators, e.g. `+`
- funspotr has lots of dependencies. It may have make sense to move some
  of the non-core functionality into a separate package (e.g. stuff
  concerning `list_files*()`)
- Rather than running
  [`list_files_github_repo()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/list_files_github_repo.md)
  it may make sense to instead clone the repo locally and then run
  [`list_files_wd()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/list_files_wd.md)
  from the repo prior to running
  [`spot_funs_files()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs_files.md)
  as this will limit the number of API hits to github.
- Currently it’s possible to have github block you pretty soon due to
  hitting too many files (in which case you’ll likely get a 403 or
  connection error). There are some things that could be done to reduce
  number of github API hits (e.g. above bullet, or using
  [`Sys.sleep()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.sleep.html), …).
- Throughout the code and package documentation I have “inspiration”
  bullets followed by a link pointing to places where I took stuff from
  stack overflow, github, or other packages. Also see the footnotes of
  the README.

2.  Rather than, for example,
    [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) workflows. Also, in
    some cases funspotr may not identify *every* function and/or package
    in a file (see [Limitations, problems,
    musings](#limitations-problems-musings) or read the source code for
    details).

3.  Other arguments may produce additional columns. See
    [`spot_funs()`](https://brshallo.github.io/funspotr/reference/spot_funs.md)
    reference page for details.

4.  list-column output where each item is a list containing `result` and
    `error`.

5.  Took inspiration from
    [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) method in
    [cranly](https://github.com/ikosmidis/cranly).

6.  [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) is a more robust approach to
    finding and installing dependencies – particularly in cases where
    you are missing many dependencies or don’t want to alter the
    packages in your global library.

7.  This heuristic is imperfect and means that a file with
    “library(dplyr); select(); MASS::select()” would view both
    [`select()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html)
    calls as coming from {MASS} – when what it should do is view the
    first was as coming from {dplyr} and the second from {MASS}.

8.  For example… If you pass in a .Rmd or .qmd that has a mix of R and
    python code chunks, the python chunks will simply be commented out.
    If you pass in a python script, you will almost certainly get a
    parsing error for that file.

9.  In a language like python, where calls are more explicit
    (e.g. `np.*`), all of the stuff with recreating the search space
    would likely be unnecessary and you could more easily just identify
    packages/functions by parsing the text.

10. i.e. in interactive R scripts or Rmd or qmd documents where you use
    [`library()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html) or related calls
    within the script.

11. For example when reviewing David Robinson’s Tidy Tuesday code I
    found that the [meme](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/meme) package
    was used far more than I would have expected. Turns out it was just
    due to it reexporting the `aes()` function from ggplot.

12. e.g. in this case `lines <- "library(pkg)"` the `pkg` would show-up
    as a dependency despite just being part of a quote rather than
    actually loaded. See
    [\#14](https://github.com/brshallo/funspotr/issues/14) for
    disucssion of other approaches.
